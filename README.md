This repository contains the implementation of uninformed and informed search algorithms to solve pathfinding and planning problems in the classic Pac-Man domain. The project evaluates Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and A* Search, along with custom-designed admissible and consistent heuristics for complex state-space problems.

## 🧠 Algorithms & Problem Formulations

This project completes the following fundamental AI search problems:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Graph search utilizing a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) Stack.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Graph search utilizing a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) Queue to guarantee shortest paths in unweighted graphs.
3. **Uniform Cost Search (UCS):** Priority Queue implementation to find the lowest-cost path in weighted graphs.
4. **A* Search:** Informed search combining UCS path costs ($g(n)$) with heuristic estimations ($h(n)$).
5. **Corners Problem:** Formulating a search problem where the state includes both Pac-Man's coordinates and the unvisited corners.
6. **Corners Heuristic:** Designing an admissible and consistent non-trivial heuristic for the Corners Problem.
7. **Eating All The Dots:** Designing an optimized heuristic for the Food Search problem to minimize node expansion.

## 📂 Project Structure

While the project includes the entire Pac-Man environment framework, our team's specific implementations are located within the following core files:

*   `search.py`: Contains all the core search algorithms (DFS, BFS, UCS, A*).
*   `searchAgents.py`: Contains the search-based agents, state space formulations, and heuristic functions.

> **Note:** All other files (e.g., `pacman.py`, `game.py`, `util.py`) remain unmodified as per the assignment specifications.
